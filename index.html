    <h1>Blog post 1: Animation Troubles</h1>
    <p><strong>By: Connor Miller</strong> <br>

    <h2>Problems I've had today working on my Game</h2>
    <p>For everyone reading, welcome to my first blog post. In these blog posts I will be <br>
        discussing the varies issues I have faced while making a video game, as well as how I <br>
        overcame said issues. Todays issue I will be discussing will be the issue of animation, <br>
        and how I was able to learn how to animate. <br>
    </p>
    <p>The main issue I ran into with animating the character in my game was how to make sure the <br>
        different animation triggered when they were supposed to. For example, if my game character was <br>
        lifting up a box, the animation should show him lifting up said box. The way I was able to make the <br>
        animations work correctly was by creating different Booleans (true/false statements) that would activate <br>
        when the player picked up a box or did someother task. This would make it so that the player would <br>
        show the correct animations for the different tasks correcctly. <br>
    </p>
    <p>The main resource I use when trying to figure out any of my game problems is the many many videos on Youtube, <br>
        as many people have quick and easy solutions since many of the problems I run into are not new issues within <br>
        the community. <br>

        are similiar to the ones in my game </p>

    <p>Welcome everyone to my second blog post. In today's post we will be talking About<br>
        the wonderful joys and troubles that come with designing video game levels.<br>
        For the game that I am working on, I most recently finished up the design for our <br>
        main level. While it was a lot of fun to make and I am happy with the end result, I <br>
        had my fair share of issues. The biggest one that I had was capturing the feel of our game.<br>
        Each game has it own theme and environment, and as a level designer it's important to try and<br>
        capture that theme and envirnment as best you can with your levels. As a result, many (if not all)<br>
        of your levels will go through various changes while you are building them, a majority of them for the better.<br>
