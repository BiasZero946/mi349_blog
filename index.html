    <h2>Blog post 1: Animation Troubles</h2>
    <p><strong>By: Connor Miller</strong> <br>

    <h3>Problems I've had today working on my Game</h3>
    <p>For everyone reading, welcome to my first blog post. In these blog posts I will be 
        discussing the varies issues I have faced while making a video game, as well as how I 
        overcame said issues. Todays issue I will be discussing will be the issue of animation, 
        and how I was able to learn how to animate. 
    </p>
    <p>The main issue I ran into with animating the character in my game was how to make sure the 
        different animation triggered when they were supposed to. For example, if my game character was
        lifting up a box, the animation should show him lifting up said box. The way I was able to make the 
        animations work correctly was by creating different Booleans (true/false statements) that would activate 
        when the player picked up a box or did someother task. This would make it so that the player would 
        show the correct animations for the different tasks correcctly. 
    </p>
    <p>The main resource I use when trying to figure out any of my game problems is the many many videos on Youtube, 
        as many people have quick and easy solutions since many of the problems I run into are not new issues within 
        the community. <br>

    <p>Welcome everyone to my second blog post. In today's post we will be talking About
        the wonderful joys and troubles that come with designing video game levels.
        For the game that I am working on, I most recently finished up the design for our 
        main level. While it was a lot of fun to make and I am happy with the end result, I 
        had my fair share of issues. The biggest one that I had was capturing the feel of our game.
        Each game has it own theme and environment, and as a level designer it's important to try and
        capture that theme and envirnment as best you can with your levels. As a result, many (if not all)
        of your levels will go through various changes while you are building them, a majority of them for the better.
